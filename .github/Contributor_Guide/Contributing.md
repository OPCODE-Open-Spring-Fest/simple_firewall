# Contributing to Simple Firewall

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Simple Firewall! We really appreciate it. This project aims to create an educational DDoS/DoS protection firewall with a user-friendly GUI interface.

Before contributing, please make sure to read the [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect you to follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## New to Simple Firewall?

If you are new to Simple Firewall, please take a look at the [Project Tour](./Project_Tour.md) documentation. It's a great place to start understanding the codebase structure and architecture.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project:
1. Read the main [README.md](../../README.md) for project overview
2. Check out the [Project Tour](./Project_Tour.md) for detailed code walkthrough
3. Review the [firewall_config.json](../../firewall_config.json) to understand configuration options
4. Explore the new modular structure in [src/](../../src/) directory:
   - `src/firewall/core.py` - Main firewall orchestration
   - `src/config/loader.py` - Configuration management
   - `src/network/packet_handler.py` - Network packet processing
   - `main.py` - Modern CLI entry point

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

#### All Platforms
- **Python 3.8+** (recommended 3.10+)
- **Node.js 16+** (for commit hooks and future GUI development)
- **Git** for version control

#### Linux (Primary Development Platform)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv nodejs npm

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S python python-pip nodejs npm

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install python3 python3-pip nodejs npm
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install python3 node

# Install Xcode Command Line Tools (required for some Python packages)
xcode-select --install
```

#### Windows
```powershell
# Using Chocolatey (recommended)
choco install python nodejs

# Or download from official websites:
# Python: https://python.org/downloads
# Node.js: https://nodejs.org/downloads
```

### Project Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simple_firewall.git
   cd simple_firewall
   ```

2. **Set up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # Linux/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Development Tools**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js dependencies (for commit hooks)
   npm install
   
   # This will set up Husky git hooks automatically
   ```

4. **Create Configuration File**
   ```bash
   # Generate configuration template with the new CLI
   python3 main.py --create-config
   
   # Edit configuration as needed
   nano firewall_config.json
   ```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Linux
- Requires `sudo` privileges for iptables operations
- Install libpcap development headers:
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install libpcap-dev
  # Arch Linux  
  sudo pacman -S libpcap
  ```

#### macOS
- Uses `pfctl` instead of `iptables` (implementation needed)
- Install libpcap via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install libpcap
  ```
- May require running with `sudo` for packet capture

#### Windows
- Requires Npcap or WinPcap for packet capture
- Uses Windows Firewall API instead of iptables (implementation needed)
- Install Npcap: https://npcap.org/
